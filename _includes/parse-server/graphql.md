# GraphQL

[GraphQL](https://graphql.org/), developed by Facebook, is an open-source data query and manipulation language for APIs. In addition to the traditional REST API, Parse Server automatically generates a GraphQL API based on your current application schema. Parse Server also allows you to define your custom GraphQL queries and mutations, whose resolvers can be bound to your cloud code functions.

## Running

### Using the CLI

The easiest way to run the Parse GraphQL API is through the CLI:

```bash
$ npm install -g parse-server mongodb-runner
$ mongodb-runner start
$ parse-server --appId APPLICATION_ID --masterKey MASTER_KEY --databaseURI mongodb://localhost/test --publicServerURL http://localhost:1337/parse --mountGraphQL --mountPlayground
```

After starting the server, you can visit http://localhost:1337/playground in your browser to start playing with your GraphQL API.

Note:

- Do **NOT** use --mountPlayground option in production. [Parse Dashboard](https://github.com/parse-community/parse-dashboard) has a built-in GraphQL Playground and it is the recommended option for production apps.

### Using Docker

You can also run the Parse GraphQL API inside a Docker container:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/parse-community/parse-server
$ cd parse-server
$ docker build --tag parse-server .
$ docker run --name my-mongo -d mongo
```

#### Running the Parse Server Image

```bash
$ docker run --name my-parse-server --link my-mongo:mongo -v config-vol:/parse-server/config -p 1337:1337 -d parse-server --appId APPLICATION_ID --masterKey MASTER_KEY --databaseURI mongodb://mongo/test --publicServerURL http://localhost:1337/parse --mountGraphQL --mountPlayground
```

Note:

* If you want to use [Cloud Code]({{ site.baseUrl }}/cloudcode/guide/) feature, please add `-v cloud-code-vol:/parse-server/cloud --cloud /parse-server/cloud/main.js` to command above. Make sure the `main.js` file is available in the `cloud-code-vol` directory before run this command. Otherwise, an error will occur.

After starting the server, you can visit http://localhost:1337/playground in your browser to start playing with your GraphQL API.

## Learning more

The [Parse GraphQL Guide]({{ site.baseUrl }}/graphql/guide/) is a very good source for learning how to use the Parse GraphQL API.

You also have a very powerful tool inside your GraphQL Playground. Please look at the right side of your GraphQL Playground. You will see the `DOCS` and `SCHEMA` menus. They are automatically generated by analyzing your application schema. Please refer to them and learn more about everything that you can do with your Parse GraphQL API.

Additionally, the [GraphQL Learn Section](https://graphql.org/learn/) is a very good source to learn more about the power of the GraphQL language.
