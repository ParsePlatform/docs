# Adapters

All official adapters are distributed as scoped pacakges on [npm (@parse)](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=scope%3Aparse).

Some adapters are also available on the [Parse Server Modules](https://github.com/parse-server-modules) organization.

You can also find more adapters maintained by the community by searching on [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=parse-server%20adapter&page=1&ranking=optimal).
