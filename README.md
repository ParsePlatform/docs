# Parse Docs

These are the markdown version of all the [platform guides](https://parse.com/docs) of Parse. The content for the guides is stored in this repo, and we use a [Background Job](https://parse.com/docs/js/guide#cloud-code-advanced-background-jobs) to process the markdown and store it in a Parse app. The guides you see on our website are simply served from this Parse app!

## How Do I Contribute?

If you have any fix or suggestion, simply send us a pull request! The guides are organized first by language, then by platform. So for example, `/en/ios/` contains all of sections for the iOS guide in English. You'll notice a `common` folder in each language. This folder contains content that is shared amongst all of the platform. That helps us not duplicate content unnecessarily.

## Can I Access The Docs Offline?

This repository is public and all the files are in markdown. If you'd like to keep a copy locally, please do!
