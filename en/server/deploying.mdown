# Deploying to Heroku and MongoLab

Heroku and MongoLab provide an easy way to deploy Parse Server, especially if you're new to managing your own backend infrastructure.

Here are the steps:

1. Create a repo for your Express app with the Parse Server middleware mounted (you can use our sample project, or start your own).
2. Create a Heroku account (if you donâ€™t have one already) and use the Heroku Toolbelt to log in and prepare a new app in the same directory as your Express app. Take a look at Heroku's [Getting Started with Node.js guide](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-nodejs#introduction) for more details.
3. Use the MongoLab addon: `heroku addons:create mongolab:sandbox` (or, you can create a Mongo instance yourself, either directly with MongoLab or your own box)
4. Use heroku config and note the URI provided by MongoLab under the var MONGOLAB_URI
5. Copy this URI and set it as a new config variable: heroku config:set `DATABASE_URI=mongodb://...`
6. Deploy it: `git push heroku master`

# Deploying to Google App Engine and MongoLab

Google App Engine and MongoLab make it easy to build scalable node.js applications on Google's infrastructure. For a basic guide on setting up node.js applications on Google App Engine, check out the [getting started guide](https://cloud.google.com/nodejs/getting-started/hello-world).

### Run the sample locally

1. `git clone https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/nodejs-docs-samples.git`
2. `cd appengine/parse-server`
3. `npm install`
4. Set the necessary [environment variables](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/nodejs-docs-samples/blob/master/appengine/parse-server/server.js#L23).
5. `npm start`

### Create a project on Google Cloud

1. Create a project in the [Google Cloud Platform Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
2. [Enable billing](https://console.cloud.google.com/project/_/settings) for your project.
3. Install the [Google Cloud SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/).
4. Setup a MongoDB server.  You have a few options:
  1. Create a Google Compute Engine virtual machine with [MongoDB pre-installed](https://cloud.google.com/launcher/?q=mongodb).
  2. Use [MongoLab](https://mongolab.com/google/) to create a free MongoDB deployment on Google Cloud Platform.

### Deploy

1. Modify `app.yaml` to update your environment variables. 
2. `gcloud preview app deploy`
